<p>There are probably a ton of horror stories out there that go 
unnoticed.  I'm finally finished with my degree after changing labs 
once, which means I had to work extra hard to finish.  My new lab, I 
wasn't given a project..  As a parting gift, my first-author paper is 
being forced into co-first authorship with one of his pets that did no 
work on it.  I was then told to "be an adult" about it.  I received less
 than a handful of authorships on papers that went out, while the 
favored students received close to a dozen for no real effort.</p><p>My advice:<br>Pick
 someone from your own culture - if you're an American, pick an 
American.  If you're Indian , your adviser should be Indian.  The halls 
of academia operate nearly above the law because outside observers are 
hostage to the complexities of research, and will often defer to the 
'authority figure'.  There are no real protections for students in this 
environment, and your adviser is free to discriminate and treat you any 
way they want to.  Yes, this means they'll lift up your lab mates if 
they have the right skin color.  Grooming and accolades are a big part 
of being seen as successful in grad school.  Right or wrong, people that
 work less hard, or have their projects handed to them will be more 
successful than you if they have an adviser putting them on the fast 
track.</p><p>Pick an adviser that's young and hungry.  Don't pick an 
adviser in his 60's a few years away from retirement.  Post-docs should 
be available to give advice and help you out.  If they aren't willing, 
that PhD is a POS and don't be afraid to let them know it.  You're going
 to suffer with or without their help anyway.</p><p>You're all in it for
 the same cause right?  Wrong.  Most of the people working in these labs
 are tourists.  Post docs are there for as long as their contract runs 
out, sometimes a year or two.  As a grad student, stay away from tourist
 traps.  A supportive environment will be one that has people with 
roots, dedicated to the health of the lab.</p><p>Getting through the 
maze is gambling with your future, always bet on yourself and be 
confident doing it.  This is often a competitive, heartless environment 
and don't let people take that away from you.</p><p>Unless you've got a 
masters degree and a decent amount of research experience, don't pick an
 adviser that doesn't make it a daily habit to come to lab, check in 
with students and have a clear plan to move your project forward.  It 
should be completely clear that his success is tied to your success.  
Without publications, no lab gets funded.  Don't pick a lab that isn't 
regularly publishing.  An adviser that doesn't care is a lab in the act 
of falling apart, no matter how well funded.</p><p>If you're stuck in a 
lab that isn't giving you what you need, get help elsewhere.  Do your 
experiments one at a time, and generate your figure.  If you get hung up
 on some technical aspect, usually this is something easy that can be 
quickly corrected by someone that's ran the experiment themselves.  
Networking will give you power.</p>

<p>Hey. U r article is good and I am also suffering because of my 
supervisor. My supervisor doesn't listen to what I say and say Donno if I
 ask any doubt ( both technical and internal policies). But when I go 
and meet with other professor for clearing a doubt he scolds me for not 
going through him. I need him for a later part of my thesis and so I 
don't want to piss him off. I also thought of solving this issue with 
department head but I am afraid they will support him only. I am so 
broken and donno what to do</p>

<p>Thank you very much for writing this and believe it or not, the same 
situation that happened to you is happening to me. My adviser is the 
chair to my department and oh yes I do feel hopeless because no matter 
which way I am reaching out people are ignoring me. Right now they are 
pending my visa renewal process which is a silent way to block me from 
continuing my doctorate degree-which I am in the middle of completing 
it. I am going to work my way through this and I am getting mentally 
stronger everyday. You are right it is not the end of the world when 
something like this happen and it is not "normal". A bad adviser is a 
bad adviser, regardless. I guess for me is to find a supportive friend 
or partner that would help with motivations is very crucial. As for me, 
my family do not even get my struggles and trust me it is hard. However I
 am glad I have an extremely supportive fiance who never hesitate to hug
 me when I was down, or give a slight kick to make sure I realized that I
 have a battle to fight and continue to fight for my own right. I agree,
 having a back up plan is something very important and I am craving mine
 now. Thanks for the last highlight on do less not more. Though first I 
was like Whhhhaaattttt!!! but then, yes I got you. Thanks for sharing 
and all the best in your journey.</p>

<p>I wished I had this when I was in graduate school.  I too was badly 
mistreated by my advisor and I was forced out of the program without my 
degree.  He was chair of the department as well.  He was never in the 
lab, when I went to him for advice on walls I was hitting all I got was 
shrugged sholders.  I had project ideas stolen from me, I was belittled,
 and basically mentally reduced to nothing.  The time there is still 
even haunting me today because I can't get into a new graduate program 
cause I'm viewed as a failure, and not a job because I'm not 
"experienced" enough.</p>

<p>I'm in a similar boat right now. My PI is doing everything he can to 
prevent me from thinking that i have a chance somewhere else. of course 
he's wrong. i kept reading these articles and realized that I can make a
 change.</p><p>there are tons of opportunities out there if you continue
 to look. I'm actually running away from this hell even after getting 
multiple post doc offers. i'm looking forward to a new life as I'm 
applying to a new PhD program. i'm starting fresh.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that. I can feel your suffering and miseries. I heard 
that if you can't get your Ph.D, usually schools will give you at least 
masters of someking before officially cutting you off. I Don't know 
which school you did went into but I would do deep research on the 
schools attrition rates before I even enter a Ph.D program. Because I 
heard some schools hire more Ph.Ds to do work and when they run out of 
the funds, they force some Ph.Ds out using the same excuse as yours. I 
would advice you to go to school and do a Masters in "different but 
similar" subject as your last Ph.D. In this way, you will have at least 
some shot at getting a job. Also do some research during the masters; it
 might help you in getting into a Ph.D again IF NOT INSIDE THE US then 
out side it. But most important, remember life doesn't end here: If a 
window is close, a door might be open, only we have to comeout of our 
negativity and look around for that open door.</p>

<p>I'm a junior undergrad and I'll be in College for two extra years 
because my previous advisor my freshmen year screwed me way over. I made
 the mistake of sharing my goals and aspirations to be a psychiatrist 
(I've since changed my mind and major) but my math score were poor and I
 would have to take remedial math courses. That didn't bother me because
 I'm going to school to improve myself and grades and if that meant 
graduating a year late, oh well. There was another student in the room 
being advised by another advisor and she told me very loudly "no, you 
can't be a psychiatrist. You can't with those scores. It's not even 
possible. You have to go to medical school. And no. You just can't." 
Seriously. I was so embarrassed. This was my first advising session 
during our schools mandatory new student orientation. Best believe I was
 not motivated to go to this school anymore after that experience. 
Anyway, I let her overload me with a bunch of classes I didn't need for 
the first and second semester. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I 
trusted her...which was my biggest mistake. Not a single math or science
 class and she wouldn't even try to help me get into a math class when I
 brought it up. So, I transferred because I was tired of the bull and i 
was miserable at that university. I'm doing much better now and taking 
the classes I need. Luckily and sadly I met a lot of people on campus 
when I was attending the first university that went through the same 
crappy advising experiences and they too transferred. Funny because my 
pervious school is considered one of the top schools in my state and has
 the best vet med school in the US...yet the worst faculty advising 
ever. </p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this story Caramel. You're right, there's nothing 
worse than a bad mentor. But, at the same time, there's nothing better 
than a good mentor. I hope your future mentorship experiences are 
better.</p>

<p>Just discovered this post. Not a post-grad student (and never will 
pursue it after my horrible undergrad experience), but these things also
 happen in undergrad.  In my university in engineering professors seem 
free to whatever they want short of sexual harassment.  I saw and 
experienced a lot of unfair situations, from professors not following 
protocol to just playing favoritism. It was horrible because nobody 
dared to do anything since they didn't want to burn any bridges (going 
into graduare school has become way too popular in engineering) or just 
end up disliked on top of the poor protocol following.</p><p>My worst 
experience was in a group project I was stuck with someone who simply 
was not helping me, he was being lazy and not doing enough of the work. 
In the end I finished what I could by myself and the professor was not 
pleased, he gave us an incomplete and I told him simply that I did my 
part and should not be punished for my partner's lack of interest.  Long
 story short it didn't work out and I ended up getting plagiarized since
 his solution was having each of us turn in individual work.  I ended up
 basically having to do new work while my former partner finally did the
 part he had not done in time for himself and used my work as well (we 
had a Google Drive folder) .  It was professor approved plagiarism as he
 didn't do anything about it despite mh protests. I couldn't do much 
without dwelling in hours of bureaucracy since the professor was the 
department head.</p><p>It sucks seeing other people had similar experiences, but at least makes me feel like I wasn't alone. </p>

<p>I graduated this spring with a MS degree from the Electrical and 
Computer Engineering department from Southern Illinois University 
Carbondale. However, I joined the department as a PhD student! I must 
tell you that the ECE department at SIU Carbondale is worse than hell. 
It is dominated by few narcissistic people from Greece who don't care 
about anything other than their fat paychecks(over 100K). These 
professors are extremely abusive to graduate students and see them as 
their potential competitor. They treat PhD students as their slaves and 
punish them by delaying their graduation. You will see 6/7 year PhD 
students in the ECE Dept. Presently PhD dropout rate is over 90% in the 
ECE Dept. I know PhD students who worked for over 6 years and left 
without the degree. DO NOT JOIN.</p>

<p>what does it mean when your adviser says they think they are "a 
terrible adviser for you"?  My adviser just said that to me and I have a
 committee meeting in ~1wk! I know we have had our differences over the 
last year -- basically there was a project that my PI wanted me to do 
and I said I didn't want to because it was a distraction from my thesis 
work (which was already set to include 2 publications). My PI then told 
me "too bad".  Meanwhile my PI tried recruiting a post-doc in the lab to
 help with the project.  the Post-doc also didn't want to be apart of it
 (basically we both think the hypothesis is wrong, interesting and 
really cool, but wrong).  As of now, the hypothesis is rarely mentioned 
and I'm not asked about where the project stands at all.  It's awkward. 
 Meanwhile I'm pushing on my other 2 projects and I think they are going
 well.  My PI is trying to work on communicating better with me so we 
decide on things together rather than them just telling me what to do.  
But then today they said the above statement.  I'm not sure if I should 
do anything or not about this?</p>

<p>If your PhD advisor mistreats you, make sure to graduate and get a 
job in industry making more money than him. Following, let him know, 
very clearly, that you are richer and happier than he will ever be. 
After that register his email in every existent porn site and pay for a 
specialized prank company to send a box full of horse shit to his office
 with no possibility of return. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Hi, I have a similar problem but it was luck that this happened at 
the first half year and I quitted one month ago. I would like to call 
this guy as an ah, cutting my funding to support him to hire a postdoc 
instead, but as you mentioned in your blog, I kept all the records I 
have and sued him, eventually, I won and I quitted. I just wanted to 
warn him this was a big mistake he made in his academic career.</p>

<p>I don't have a similar problem owing to the fact that I have yet to 
embark on a PhD, however I am disabled and the nature of my disability 
is hampering my ability to search for literature and moreover, it is 
hampering my ability to look for a suitable placement - I absolutely and
 most definitely need a supportive supervisor. Are there any tips you 
can give me that will help me to overcome such issues? (my limitations 
come from dislocating/subluxing joints - including my fingers, wrists, 
elbows and shoulders; assistive technologies that I was issued with have
 not broken down barriers), any advice will be warmly welcomed.</p>

<p>Wish I had read this two years ago. I got out, too, but without the 
degree. I went into my doctoral program naively believing that my 
professors and mentors had my best interests at heart. Most did, but 
unfortunately, not the most powerful person--my adviser and committee 
chair. Who, yes, like in your case, was one and the same person. I had 
straight A's, passed the comps, fulfilled the requirements of my 
two-year assistantship, collected the data for my dissertation study, 
and then walked. I had internalized all the abuse and felt I had no 
future in academia, which is where I wanted to be. I have moved on and 
life is good, but it was all a painful experience. People like your 
adviser, and mine, need to be forced to face their behavior. Thank you 
for standing up to yours. Wish I had done the same.</p>

<p>This post is very good. Some people are just hostile to some people 
like these advisors. My story is like this  ... I thought I have got an 
opprotunity to study PhD at first when I came from a developing country.
 But later I realized that my advisor has a problem that every student 
feels mistreated by her. She has a habit of mistreating even worse those
 students from developong countries. It is surprising that she herself 
was from developing country. She has no history of advising more than 1 
student. As soon as I came, i heard that one student from developing 
country left her. Other students told me he was active and enthiusiastic
 when he first came. I felt sorry for him but I thought may be I could 
do better. I was wrong! After three months she started to show off her 
hostile behavior.  She even freighten me at times, if I dont deliver it 
within few tight days, she would write a letter to authorities to deport
 me. At first I was shaky, but now I dont care.  I will contact another 
advisor or leave for my country. </p>

<p>I started a PhD program with a poor advisor (sexist, tyrant, and 
money driven). This advisor seemed more concerned about his reputation 
than actually helping students (he was tenured). The entire department 
did not have adequate funding for all the students that they accepted 
and was poorly managed.. About 6 months into it, I realized that there 
was no way I was going to be able to survive 5-6 years through all the 
mis-management. I started calling around to my contacts, looked for a 
different program at other universities. I found another program I 
liked, called the department chair and talked about my goals. Within 2 
months, I left my program and started a new program. I finished in just 
under four years and got a tenure-track position ABD. So, you don't have
 to put up with a bad advisor. There are alternatives.</p>
