in Mars last years, I went to the national museum of history in Washintone DC when i was in internship in US,

I went there in Mars last year with my friend Fadi

I Saw a lot of things like the first care in US and the first train in Washinton DC, 
I saw also some historic women's dresses with there beautiful design. There was also a side of old music instrument   

I really enjoy by taking some picture and listen to the historic music inside the museum.
